# Golf Scorecard

A minimalist golfing companion app.

Built and designed on my own in April 2016 to satisfy a coding challenge from the [Android Activity Lifecycle](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/android-activity-lifecycle) 
course at [Team Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/), this app does one thing and one thing only: keep track your golf scores. 

It uses Android's SharedPreferences to store your scores beyond the application lifetime so you can rest assured that your scores will 
be with you until you decide to clear them (either out of embarassment or self-modesty, I won't tell). Handy for the occassional weekend getaway far, far away from the wife and kids, give it a try
if you're feeling free-spirited.
